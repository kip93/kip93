Co-authored-by: Benjamin Saunders &lt;ben.e.saunders@gmail.com&gt;
  * [#9f6ed8c](https://github.com/OroraTech/nixpkgs/commit/9f6ed8c) nixos/release-notes: use redis as example for extras in synapse

postgres isn&#39;t such a good idea actually because it&#39;s added by default
to the wrapper.
  * [#701d0e1](https://github.com/OroraTech/nixpkgs/commit/701d0e1) nixos/matrix-synapse: fix path to extras for additive settings
  * [#190886c](https://github.com/OroraTech/nixpkgs/commit/190886c) nixos/matrix-synapse: clarify that `extras` are additive
  * [#5bf466d](https://github.com/OroraTech/nixpkgs/commit/5bf466d) matrix-synapse: fix PYTHONPATH wrapper
  * [#638460a](https://github.com/OroraTech/nixpkgs/commit/638460a) nixos/release-notes: reword section for synapse wrapper changes
  * [#5a3870c](https://github.com/OroraTech/nixpkgs/commit/5a3870c) nixos/matrix-synapse: expose final matrix-synapse package via `package`-option

When extending this module, it might be necessary to run something
from the package that&#39;s used in `matrix-synapse.service` (e.g. for
workers).

Now this can be trivially done by using
`config.services.matrix-synapse.package`. Previously it was necessary to
reuse the `PYTHONPATH` from the environment of `matrix-synapse.service`,
but that one doesn&#39;t exist anymore.
  * [#401be82](https://github.com/OroraTech/nixpkgs/commit/401be82) pspp: 1.4.1 -&gt; 1.6.2

Note: needs ssw &gt;= 0.7
  * [#549bc4b](https://github.com/OroraTech/nixpkgs/commit/549bc4b) nixos/tests/matrix-synapse: Test redis on postgres instance

This requires the module to pick up on the redis configuration, and add
the required extra packages for redis into the wrapper.
  * [#1076c3a](https://github.com/OroraTech/nixpkgs/commit/1076c3a) nixos/matrix-synapse: Allow passing extras, discover extras from config

With this change we allow the user to configure extras, exposed as
optional-dependencies on the matrix-synapse package.

The vertical integration between package, user configuration and
deployment is a huge boon which then allows us to dynamically adapt the
python environment the service runs in, by inspecting the configuration
and autodiscovering certain used extras from config paths.
  * [#3453128](https://github.com/OroraTech/nixpkgs/commit/3453128) matrix-synapse: Add wrapper to configure extras

The original matrix-synapse packages is now available with the
-unwrapped prefix.
  * [#fd429f5](https://github.com/OroraTech/nixpkgs/commit/fd429f5) matrix-synapse: Prune deps, add missing deps, expose extras

Drops extra arguments on the package, as they will be moved over into
the module in a more discoverable way next.

Also reduces overly broad `with`-scoping.
