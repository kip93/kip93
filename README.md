  * [#b09b4dc](https://github.com/b-camacho/nix/commit/b09b4dc) x86_64-darwin: Disable LTO

LTO on x86_64-darwin appears to break the ability to catch exceptions
correctly (maybe just for exception types defined in different
libraries). This leads to many weird test failures,
e.g. https://hydra.nixos.org/build/286312387 and
https://hydra.nixos.org/build/286312341.

  * *On 27 Jan 2025, 14:46:40*

  * [#a2e4a4c](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/a2e4a4c) callFunction: Use std::span

This is a bit safer than having a separate nrArgs argument.
  * [#11d3b01](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/11d3b01) tests/nixos: add more thorough nix-docker tests
  * [#1dda18e](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/1dda18e) doc/manual: add documentation for non-root container images
  * [#1cfb226](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/1cfb226) tests/nixos: add nix-docker test
  * [#e194e27](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/e194e27) docker: Allow building for non-root user

Add options uid, gid, uname, and gname to docker.nix.

Setting these to e.g. 1000, 1000, &#34;user&#34;, &#34;user&#34; will build an image
which runs and allows using Nix as that user.
  * [#cb0eacc](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/cb0eacc) Merge remote-tracking branch &#39;origin/master&#39; into nix-copy-gc
  * [#1c832d6](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/1c832d6) Merge remote-tracking branch &#39;origin/master&#39; into nix-copy-gc
  * [#27ea437](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/27ea437) Support fine-grained database schema migrations

Backward-compatible schema changes (e.g. those that add tables or
nullable columns) now no longer need a change to the global schema
file (/nix/var/nix/db/schema). Thus, old Nix versions can continue to
access the database.

This is especially useful for schema changes required by experimental
features. In particular, it replaces the ad-hoc handling of the schema
changes for CA derivations (i.e. the file /nix/var/nix/db/ca-schema).

Schema versions 8 and 10 could have been handled by this mechanism in
a backward-compatible way as well.
  * [#e9b5704](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/e9b5704) Add release note
  * [#7f6d006](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/7f6d006) nix copy: Add --out-link
  * [#43ad8c5](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/43ad8c5) Make getDstStore() a virtual method in StoreCommand
  * [#76f75e7](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/76f75e7) nix copy: Add --profile flag

This allows `nix copy` to atomically copy a store path and point a
profile to it, without the risk that the store path might be GC&#39;ed in
between. This is useful for instance when deploying a new NixOS system
profile from a remote store.
  * [#f206325](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/f206325) tests/functional/flakes/relative-paths.sh: Fix build failure in hydraJobs.tests.functional_user
  * [#91e7d49](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/91e7d49) Merge remote-tracking branch &#39;origin/master&#39; into relative-flakes

  * [#21fc07c](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/21fc07c) Merge remote-tracking branch &#39;origin/master&#39; into relative-flakes
  * [#3180671](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/3180671) Allow the &#39;url&#39; flake input attribute to be a path literal

https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/10089#issuecomment-1978133326
  * [#49f592d](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/49f592d) call-flake.nix: Fix relative path resolution

`parentNode.sourceInfo.outPath` does not include the subdir of the
parent flake, while `parentNode.outPath` does. So we need to use the
latter.
  * [#b2be6fe](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/b2be6fe) Improve support for subflakes

Subflakes are flakes in the same tree, accessed in flake inputs via
relative paths (e.g. `inputs.foo.url = &#34;path:./subdir&#34;`). Previously
these didn&#39;t work very well because they would be separately copied to
the store, which is inefficient and makes references to parent
directories tricky or impossible. Furthermore, they had their own NAR
hash in the lock file, which is superfluous since the parent is
already locked.

Now subflakes are accessed via the accessor of the calling flake. This
avoids the unnecessary copy and makes it possible for subflakes to
depend on flakes in a parent directory (so long as they&#39;re in the same
tree).

Lock file nodes for relative flake inputs now have a new `parent` field:

  {
    &#34;locked&#34;: {
      &#34;path&#34;: &#34;./subdir&#34;,
      &#34;type&#34;: &#34;path&#34;
    },
    &#34;original&#34;: {
      &#34;path&#34;: &#34;./subdir&#34;,
      &#34;type&#34;: &#34;path&#34;
    },
    &#34;parent&#34;: [
      &#34;foo&#34;,
      &#34;bar&#34;
    ]
  }

which denotes that `./subdir` is to be interpreted relative to the
directory of the `bar` input of the `foo` input of the root flake.
