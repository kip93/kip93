  * [#e0c6ed1](https://github.com/b-camacho/nix/commit/e0c6ed1) Fix help test in dev shell

Not sure what the intent was expecting help.sh to fail in the main suite, but it caused `meson test` to fail inside a `nix develop` shell:

  $ meson test help --print-errorlogs

x86_64-darwin: Disable LTO
  * [#b09b4dc](https://github.com/b-camacho/nix/commit/b09b4dc) x86_64-darwin: Disable LTO

LTO on x86_64-darwin appears to break the ability to catch exceptions
correctly (maybe just for exception types defined in different
libraries). This leads to many weird test failures,
e.g. https://hydra.nixos.org/build/286312387 and
https://hydra.nixos.org/build/286312341.

  * [#69fde53](https://github.com/b-camacho/nix/commit/69fde53) Clean up packaging a bit

- Multiple choices of stdenv are handled more consistently, especially for the dev
  shells which were previously not done correctly.

- Some stray nix code was moving into the `packaging` directory
