* ‚û°Ô∏è Pushed 27 commits in [kip93/nix](https://github.com/kip93/nix) on branch `master`
  * [#2eacb3c](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/2eacb3c) Merge pull request #13851 from lovesegfault/http-binary-cache-store-once

refactor(libstore/http-binary-cache-store): pragma once
  * [#0590b13](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/0590b13) Revert &#34;Add a crude tracing mechansim for the build results&#34;

The commit says it was added for CA testing --- manual I assume, since
there is no use of this in the test suite. I don&#39;t think we need it any
more, and I am not sure whether it was ever supposed to have made it to
`master` either.

This reverts commit 2eec2f765a86b8954f3a74ff148bc70a2d32be27.
  * [#241abcc](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/241abcc) refactor(libstore/http-binary-cache-store): pragma once
  * [#35978ca](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/35978ca) Merge pull request #13848 from obsidiansystems/factor-out-drv-check

Factor out `checkOutputs`
  * [#d1bdaef](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/d1bdaef) Factor out `checkOutputs`

We currently just use this during the build of a derivation, but there is no
reason we wouldn&#39;t want to use it elsewhere, e.g. to check the outputs
of someone else&#39;s build after the fact.

Moreover, I like pulling things out of `DerivationBuilder` that are
simple and don&#39;t need access to all that state. While
`DerivationBuilder` is unix-only, this refactor also make the code more
portable &#34;for free&#34;.

The header is private, at Eelco&#39;s request.
  * [#6c8f5ef](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/6c8f5ef) Merge pull request #13802 from obsidiansystems/post-build-hook-later

Move `runPostBuildHook` out of `DerivationBuilder`
  * [#193ad73](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/193ad73) Merge pull request #13808 from obsidiansystems/derivation-builder-kvm

Create `StringSet DerivationBuilderParams::systemFeatures`
  * [#f4a0161](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/f4a0161) Create `StringSet DerivationBuilderParams::systemFeatures`

Do this to avoid checking &#34;system features&#34; from the store config
directly, because we rather not have `DerivationBuilder` depend on
`Store`.
  * [#79211b6](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/79211b6) Merge pull request #13846 from obsidiansystems/derivation-builder-params-aggregate-initialize

No more `DerivationBuilderParams:` constructor!
  * [#f5f9e32](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/f5f9e32) No more `DerivationBuilderParams:` constructor!

I am not sure how/why this started working. C++23?
  * [#564593b](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/564593b) Merge pull request #13837 from xokdvium/bump-nixpkgs

flake: Update nixpkgs
  * [#8ee7479](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/8ee7479) Merge pull request #13819 from obsidiansystems/relative-url

Implement `parseURLRelative`, use in `HttpBinaryCacheStore`
  * [#e82210b](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/e82210b) Implement `parseURLRelative`, use in `HttpBinaryCacheStore`

This allows us to replace some very hacky and not correct string
concatentation in `HttpBinaryCacheStore`. It will especially be useful
with #13752, when today&#39;s hacks started to cause problems in practice,
not just theory.

Also make `fixGitURL` returned a `ParsedURL`.
  * [#625477a](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/625477a) flake: Update nixpkgs

‚Ä¢ Updated input &#39;nixpkgs&#39;:
    &#39;github:NixOS/nixpkgs/cd32a774ac52caaa03bcfc9e7591ac8c18617ced?narHash=sha256-VtMQg02B3kt1oejwwrGn50U9Xbjgzfbb5TV5Wtx8dKI%3D&#39; (2025-08-17)
  ‚Üí &#39;github:NixOS/nixpkgs/d98ce345cdab58477ca61855540999c86577d19d?narHash=sha256-O2CIn7HjZwEGqBrwu9EU76zlmA5dbmna7jL1XUmAId8%3D&#39; (2025-08-26)

This update contains d1266642a8722f2a05e311fa151c1413d2b9653c, which
is necessary for the TOML timestamps to get tested via nixpkgsLibTests job.
  * [#231f3af](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/231f3af) Merge pull request #13835 from obsidiansystems/better-string-split

Better `stringSplit`
  * [#cc4aa70](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/cc4aa70) Better `stringSplit`

I need this for some `ParseURL` improvements, but I figure this is
better to send as its own PR.

I changed the tests willy-nilly to sometimes use
`std::list&lt;std::string_view&gt;` instead of `Strings` (which is
`std::list&lt;std::string&gt;`).

  * [#0bd9d6a](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/0bd9d6a) Merge pull request #13832 from kip93/fix/empty-ports

Handle empty ports with new URL parsing
  * [#7989e31](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/7989e31) Handle empty ports
  * [#0250d50](https://github.com/kip93/nix/commit/0250d50) Move `runPostBuildHook` out of `DerivationBuilder`

It is suppposed to be &#34;post build&#34; not &#34;during the build&#34; after all. Its
location now matches that for the hook case (see elsewhere in
`DerivationdBuildingGoal`).

It was in a try-catch before, and now it isn&#39;t, but I believe that it is
impossible for it to throw `BuildError`, which is sufficient for this
code motion to be correct.
